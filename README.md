<h2>CARD GUARD</h2>
<p>This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of anonymized transactions from a financial institution, including both fraudulent and legitimate records. The goal is to build an efficient classifier that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.</p>

<h4>KEY FEATURES</h4>
<li>Dataset: The dataset is highly imbalanced with a very small percentage of fraud cases.
<li>Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned, scaled, and features are engineered to enhance model performance.
Modeling: Various machine learning models are implemented, including :-  <b>Support Vector Machine</b> and <b>Decision Trees</b>
